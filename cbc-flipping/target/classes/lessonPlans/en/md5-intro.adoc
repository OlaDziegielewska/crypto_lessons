== Hash length extension attack

An application is susceptible to a hash length extension attack if it prepends a secret value to a string, hashes it with a vulnerable algorithm, and entrusts the attacker with both the string and the hash, but not the secret. Then, the server relies on the secret to decide whether or not the data returned later is the same as the original data.

=== Example

Let's look at a step-by-step example. For this example:

let secret = "secret"
let data = "data"
let H = md5()
let signature = hash(secret || data) = 6036708eba0d11f6ef52ad44e8b74d5b
let append = "append"
The server sends data and signature to the attacker. The attacker guesses that H is MD5 simply by its length (it's the most common 128-bit hashing algorithm), based on the source, or the application's specs, or any way they are able to.

Knowing only data, H, and signature, the attacker's goal is to append append to data and generate a valid signature for the new data. And that's easy to do! Let's see how.
